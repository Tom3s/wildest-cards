# Uno, but worse

## Basic idea

make a UNO game, where bunch of different house rules and special edition rules are all combined into one chaotic mess.

- extra feature: players can create their own cards
  
## Rules

### Basic rules

- i want however many players, but 2-12 is a good range
- each player starts with 5-8 cards (will see what works best)
- the top card of the deck is flipped over and placed face-up on the table
- we start clockwise
- you have to match color or number
- if you can't match, you draw a card (if drawn card can be played, you can play it)

### Special cards

- draw x: next player draws x cards and skips turn (there may be more values of x) - additionally, you can avoid drawing by playing a card of the same or higher value
- skip: next player skips turn
- reverse: reverses the direction of play
- wild: you can play this card on any card, and you can change the color to anything you want
- wild draw x: you can play this card on any card, and you can change the color to anything you want. additionally, the next player draws x cards and skips turn - they can void it with another wild draw x or a draw x of the same color and 1 value higher (ie. wild +3, that asks for red, can be avoided with min. a red +4 or a wild +3)
- swap hands (colored): you swap hand with the player of your choice
- swap colors (colored): everyone give all of your cards of a certain color to the next player

### Extra card features

- cards may be of multiple colors, and can be played on any of those colors
- cards may have multiple numbers, and can be played on any of those numbers
- wild cards can be played on any card, but may only change to a color it shows
- there are more than 4 colors
